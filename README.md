### Binary coverage tool for linux using ptrace and breakpoint interrupts 

Quick way to gather and analyze linux process coverage using ptrace-breakpoints based approach. It uses software interrupt 0xCC to set breakpoints on coverage points generated by (using NM). Each hit to the breakpoint is then recorded and breakpoint is restored. 

Usage:

```   
   nm -C /path/to/bin > nm.out
   ./ldbgtrace <ldbgargs> -- /path/to/bin <binargs>
```

Notes:

1. uses ptrace api for debugging native C/C++ application
2. use nm to extract symbols from exe (ldbgtrace looks for nm.out in current directory for breakpoints points)
3. in case stripped binary use disassembler (IDA) to extract break points from binary and write it in the form of nm output)
    

TODO:

1. 32 bit testing
2. support different symbol readers
3. support different coverage analyzers
4. shared module coverage? (currently only support statically compiled)
(Notes;
  currently in progrese. when ptraced to new process, we don't get loaded modules, look for ptrace clone option
 )
5. timeout support
(Notes;
   currently done outside process using 'killall' command
 ) 

6. think of more optimization in symbol readers and trace writers
7. single load multi-trace-invocation provision (in case of generating more trace for input suite) may ne shared lib
